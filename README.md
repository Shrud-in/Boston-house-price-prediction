# Boston-house-price-prediction
This is my Machine Learning project using Python. This ML model is used to predict the prices of houses using boston house dataset.

Machine Learning using Python - Boston house price prediction

A linear regression ML models has been developed and trained using training dataset. The dataset used in this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represents aggregate information about 14 features of homes from various suburbs located in Boston.
For this project, we have used the 'LSAT' features from the dataset where LSTAT stands for the percentage lower status of the population. Lower the LSTAT, lower are the house prices.

We then minimize the error function using Mean squared error method. Visualization techniques are deployed to get animated visualization of the training of regression line.
